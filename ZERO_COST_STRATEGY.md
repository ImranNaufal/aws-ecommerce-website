   # Deploy minimal demo stack
   .\scripts\deploy-windows.ps1
   ```

2. **During Interview**:
   - Show live working website
   - Demonstrate AWS services in console
   - Explain architecture using diagrams

3. **After Interview** (immediately):
   ```powershell
   # Clean up to avoid charges
   .\scripts\quick-cleanup.ps1
   ```

### **Cost for Interview Demo:**
- **Deployment time**: 2-3 hours
