## üîç **MANUAL VERIFICATION STEPS**

### **1. CloudFormation Stacks** 
**URL**: https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=ap-southeast-1

‚úÖ **Check these stacks are DELETED or DELETING:**
- `mini-ecommerce-dev-amplify`
- `mini-ecommerce-dev-api-gateway`

### **2. EC2 Instances**
**URL**: https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=ap-southeast-1#Instances:

‚úÖ **Verify**: All instances are "Terminated" or "Terminating"
**Action**: If any are still "Running", select and terminate them

---

### **3. Load Balancers**
**URL**: https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=ap-southeast-1#LoadBalancers:

‚úÖ **Verify**: No load balancers exist
**Action**: Delete any remaining load balancers

---

### **4. NAT Gateways** (EXPENSIVE!)

**Action**: No action needed - this is your portfolio showcase

---

### **7. DynamoDB Tables** (KEEP - Free Tier)
**URL**: https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/home?region=ap-southeast-1#tables:

**Why**: Free tier covers demo usage
**Action**: No action needed

- **Total**: $50-100+/month

### **AFTER CLEANUP:**
- S3 static website: ~$1-2/month
- DynamoDB (free tier): $0/month

## üéØ **WHAT YOU STILL HAVE FOR HR**

### ‚úÖ **Live Demo Website**
- **URL**: http://mini-ecommerce-dev-website-834308799940.s3-website-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/
- **Status**: Still working perfectly
- **Cost**: ~$1-2/month

### ‚úÖ **Complete GitHub Repository**
- **All AWS infrastructure code** preserved
- **Professional documentation**
- **30+ AWS services** in templates
- **Ready to deploy** when needed

### ‚úÖ **HR Presentation**
```
"I built a complete AWS e-commerce platform with 30+ services.
The live demo runs cost-effectively on S3, and I have complete
Infrastructure as Code that can deploy the full enterprise
stack in minutes when needed for production."
```

---

## üöÄ **NEXT STEPS FOR PORTFOLIO**

### **Option 1: Keep Current Setup**
- Live S3 website for demos
- Complete code in GitHub
- Deploy full stack only for interviews

### **Option 2: Use AWS Amplify**
- Professional CI/CD pipeline
- Automatic deployments from GitHub
- Custom domain with SSL
- Still cost-effective (~$5-10/month)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT REMINDERS**

### **Check These Services Manually:**
1. **VPC** - Delete custom VPCs if not needed
2. **Security Groups** - Clean up unused security groups  
3. **Key Pairs** - Delete unused EC2 key pairs
4. **CloudWatch Logs** - Set retention to 1 day
5. **Lambda Functions** - Verify all are deleted

### **Monitor Your Bill:**
- Check AWS Billing Dashboard daily for next few days
